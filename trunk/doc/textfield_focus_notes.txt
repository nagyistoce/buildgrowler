I'm having problems with TextFields and focus. Specifically now with the
password field and button presses.

When I enter some stuff in the password field and then press the start button,
no textDidChange notification is received and the field does not know it lost
focus, (which it seems to do). Tabbing, pressing enter works fine, its hitting
the start button with the mouse that sends no indication that I know of to the
text editor.

Here is an email with a suggestion of overriding controlTextDidEndEditing
http://lists.apple.com/archives/Cocoa-dev/2006/Jun/msg01450.html
but that is exactly what I am doing, except it does not seem to fire when the
button is hit with the mouse. Does the textfield not loose focus???

Also when I then press tab, after having hit the button, first the host field
is selected, with no change in the password field, press tab again, and the
port field is selected and all of a sudden the password field updates. (This is
because it gets updated due to the focus leaving the host editor).

This could have something to do with the field editor
(http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/TextEditing/Tasks/FieldEditor.html)
though I can't see what at the moment.

I think I have the same problem with the combo box, and probably the other
items.
