### Install Growl ###

If you do not already have [Growl](http://growl.info/) installed, you must do so... now! Even if you are never going to use BuildGrowler you must still install [Growl](http://growl.info/), for the sake of your own sanity and well-being.

BuildGrowler uses Growl  to display all of its notifications (and without Growl, BuildGrowler will be quite useless). Growl also has a number of different notification styles available and lets you choose to ignore or make certain notifications sticky. Hence, most of the customisation of BuildGrowler actually happens through Growl.

### Downloading ###

BuildGrowler is a Universal application (so there is just one download, which will work on both Intel and PPC Macs). Find the most recent BuildGrowler download from the [Project Home page](http://code.google.com/p/buildgrowler/) or alternative peruse the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/buildgrowler/downloads/list) section.

### Installing ###

BuildGrowler is distributed as a zip file. After downloading BuildGrowler, expand the zip file by double clicking it (alternatively use some other kind of magic of your choosing). Double clicking the file should cause the BuildGrowler application to be decompressed and it should appear in roughly the same location as the zip file. Once BuildGrowler has been decompressed, you can move it to your Applications folder, some other convenient folder, or just leave where it is. Double click BuildGrowler or, preferably, use [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/) to launch the application.


### What Next ###

  * Connect to a BuildBot server (help on using BuildGrowler is not yet available)
  * If you administer of a BuildBot server you'll need to [set it up](BuildBotSetup.md) so that BuildGrowlers can connect to it.
