**About**

BuildGrowler is being developed by Christian L. Jacobsen and is written almost entirely in [Python](http://www.python.org). It uses the most excellent [PyObjC](http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/) bridge to bind with Cocoa. BuildGrowler also uses the [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) framework to connect to BuildBot and [Growl](http://growl.info/) for displaying notifications.

**Icon**

The icon is by 'Gerald\_G' and taken from the [openclipart.org](http://openclipart.org/) website: http://openclipart.org/media/files/Gerald_G/215. This file is in the public domain. The actual icon used by BuildGrowler is a rotated version of the original.

**Keychain Integration**

The Cocoa Wrapper for the Keychain was taken from the [Adium](http://www.adiumx.org) project. These files are under the GPL License. I've packaged the small selection of files needed to support the Keychain functionality required in BuildGrowler into the BGUtils framework.
