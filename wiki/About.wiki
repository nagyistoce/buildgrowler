#summary About BuildGrowler

*About*

BuildGrowler is being developed by Christian L. Jacobsen and is written almost entirely in [http://www.python.org Python]. It uses the most excellent [http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/ PyObjC] bridge to bind with Cocoa. BuildGrowler also uses the [http://twistedmatrix.com/ Twisted] framework to connect to BuildBot and [http://growl.info/ Growl] for displaying notifications.

*Icon*

The icon is by 'Gerald_G' and taken from the [http://openclipart.org/ openclipart.org] website: http://openclipart.org/media/files/Gerald_G/215. This file is in the public domain. The actual icon used by BuildGrowler is a rotated version of the original.

*Keychain Integration*

The Cocoa Wrapper for the Keychain was taken from the [http://www.adiumx.org Adium] project. These files are under the GPL License. I've packaged the small selection of files needed to support the Keychain functionality required in BuildGrowler into the BGUtils framework.
