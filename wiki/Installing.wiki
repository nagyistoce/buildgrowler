#summary Installing BuildGrowler
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

= Dependencies =

For BuildGrowler to do anything useful at all, you will need to install the [http://growl.info/ Growl application]. If you do not have Growl, BuildGrowler will still run, but it will be of absolutely no use at all as no build events will be displayed.

= Downloading =

Download the latest version of BuildGrowler, you should be able to find a link to the latest version from the project's [http://code.google.com/p/buildgrowler/ front-page]. If you want older versions or other exotic things like that you can always browse the [http://code.google.com/p/buildgrowler/downloads/list download page]. 

= Installing =

BuildGrowler is currently distributed as a Zip file which, once downloaded, should be double clicked. This will cause the application contained in the zip file to be decompressed and deposited in the same location as the archive. You can now either run the application from where it was unzipped or drag it into the application folder (or some other folder of your choice). Once you have unarchived the application you can safely delete the downloaded zip file.

= What Next =

  * You can now launch the application, help on using BuildGrowler is not yet available :)
  * If you the administrator of a BuildBot server you'll need to [BuildBotSetup set it up] so that BuildGrowlers can connect to it.
