= Setting up your BuildBot Server = 

BuildGrowler uses the PBListener status service in BuildBot, which must therefore be configured. The BuildBot documentation contains [http://buildbot.net/repos/release/docs/buildbot.html#PBListener information on setting up a PBListener]. For your convenience the code snippet is replicated here.

{{{
     import buildbot.status.client
     pbl = buildbot.status.client.PBListener(port=int, user=str, passwd=str)
     c['status'].append(pbl)
}}}

You should probably add this bit of code around your other status services. You do not need to specify a user and password and if you don't (in the current version of BuildBot as of this writing: 0.7.5) this will use the default username and password of: "statusClient" and "clientpw", respectively. BuildGrowler is currently set up to *always* log in using these credentials. Thus, you currently need to set up your PBListener with these defaults (this will be fixed in the future).
