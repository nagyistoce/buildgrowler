BuildGrowler is a 'native' Universal OS X application that will connect to a [BuildBot](http://buildbot.net/) server and provide notifications regarding the status of the various builds performed by the server. Currently it will report _started builds_,  _finished builds_, and, most importantly, _failed builds_. Notifications are provided by the excellent [Growl](http://growl.info/) notification system, which you must install in order to use BuildGrowler.
